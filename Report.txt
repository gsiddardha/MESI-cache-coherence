Cache Implementation:
    We have implemented set-associative mapping i.e. a combination of
    direct and associative-mapping techniques. Main memory Address is
    parsed to the following format: 
    -----------------------------------
    | Tag Bits | Set Bits | Word Bits |
    -----------------------------------
   
    The number of bits for tag, set and word are calculated from the 
    block size, cache size and associativity. When we require a 
    particular memory location, we calculate three variables - 
    set_num, tag_num, word_num. These are the values of the tag bits,
    set bits and word bits, which we get by bitwise anding with 
    2^tag_bits, 2^set_bits and 2^word_bits respectively.
    
    If the block we require is present, then we return the word from 
    there. Otherwise, we return the word from the main memory and 
    add the block into the cache. When we want to add a block into 
    the cache, we
